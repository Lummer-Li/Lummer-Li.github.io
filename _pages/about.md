<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Eng.D. student at the College of Computer and Information Technology, <a href='https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/'>Beijing Jiaotong University(BJTU)</a>. My supervised by Prof. <a href='https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8516/'>Dongxia Chang</a> in the Center of Digital Media Information Processing Lab (Mepro). I have published several papers in SCI/CCF conferences and journals, including ACM MM and Neurocomputing. 

My research interests include multi-view/multi-modal representation learning, deep clustering, self-supervised learning, and contrastive learning. In particular, I focus on:

- 🧠 **Contrastive Multi-view Clustering**
- 🌐 **Self-supervised Multi-view Representation Learning**

[AEMVC: Mitigate Imbalanced Embedding Space in Multi-view Clustering](#)

**Pengyuan Li**, Man Liu, Dongxia Chang, Yiming Wang, Zisen Kong, Yao Zhao


[**Project**](https://github.com/Lummer-Li/AEMVC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We found that the embedding space learned using the encoder-decoder architecture cannot embrace the efficacy of different feature directions. Therefore, we propose a novel Activate-Then-Eliminate Strategy for Multi-View Clustering to adjust the contribution strength of different feature directions dynamically.
- We construct a feature activation module to prevent a few dominant feature directions from controlling clustering decisions. The module enhances the discriminative capacity of embedding spaces, mitigating the adverse effect of the long-tailed distribution of embedding features on multi-view representation learning.
- We design an inter-view mutual supervision strategy to refine the embedding representations. By uncovering cross-view consistency, it adaptively generates the view-specific thresholds, thus filtering out the redundant information.
